## Prerequisite

Every student who enters the class should bring their implementation of their own portfolio project. In other words, every student should bring their code and show it to teachers, ideally in CodeSandbox or locally in their VS Code environment.

## Agenda

1. Reach [Checkpoint 13](https://github.com/ReDI-School/nrw-html-and-css/tree/checkpoint13/checkpoint)
1. Do extra exercises

## 1. Reach Checkpoint 13

The goal of this class is to make sure that every student has reached checkpoint 13 in their own portfolio projects. Teachers would help students if they have not reached the checkpoint yet.

## 2. Extra exercises

If a student has reached checkpoint 13 then they can start doing extra exercises from the following list. Students can choose whatever exercise they want because there is no order. The list is solely categorized based on difficulty.

### Easy

- **Nested Flex:** Look at the template and the target result and try to apply the corresponding HTML and CSS in order to reach the target. [Resource](https://github.com/ReDI-School/nrw-html-and-css/tree/master/lesson14/exercises/nested-flex/template)

- **Instagram Stories:** Look at the template and the target result and try to apply the corresponding CSS in order to reach the target. [Resource](https://github.com/ReDI-School/nrw-html-and-css/tree/master/lesson14/exercises/ig-stories/template)
